Use the constituency tests that you see in the videos to do these exercises. 
NOTE: It is like Item 15 from last semester but with different sentences...of course ;) 

SUBSTITUTION TESTS

1) Find THE LONGET POSSIBLE NP using the substitution for a pronount test. Use that same test to answer: is 'exercise 2' an NP?

	The band that performed the song I quote from in exercise 2 split up in 1970.

2) Find the locative PP using substitution by 'here'/'there'. (locative means it denotes a PLACE relation)

	"Jojo left his home in Tucson, Arizona, for some California grass."

3) Find the temporal PP using substitution by 'then'/'now'.

	Glenn Miller still made the hit parade in those days	

4) Find the AdjP using substitution by 'so'. (2nd video at about 16 min)

	"When I call you up your line is engaged"

5) Find the VP using substitution by 'do so'. (actually two possibilities here)

	She didn't act her age.

MOVEMENT

6) Find the PP using fronting. Is there more than one? is it possible with both?

	I am sure things will get done with Janet in charge.
