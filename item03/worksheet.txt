Overview of Subordination


If you need to review what I said in the live session last week about subordination, READ THESE:
SIEG 10.1 (pp. 174-5)
SIEG 11.1 (pp. 183-4 until WH and non WH relative clauses)
SIEG 12.6 (pp. 201)
SIEG 13.1 (pp. 204)

They are the beginning sessions on the chapters about the various types of subordinate clauses. Respectively, 
10 --> content clauses
11 --> relative clauses
12 --> comparative clauses
13 --> non-finite clauses


DO THIS:

UNDERLINE THE SUBORDINATE CLAUSES.  
CLASSIFY THE SUBORDINATE (finite? content? relative? comparative? non-finite? infinitival? gerund? participial?)
 
Led by shares in technology giants, stock prices rose sharply on Monday. This caused the Dow Jones Industrial Average to rise by 353 points, or 1.2 per cent. Other financial indicators also saw gains, with the Nasdaq Composite advancing 2.9 per cent and the S&P 500 rising 1.9 per cent. The three indices are the most-followed stock markets in the United States. A key performer on Monday was Apple, which soared an impressive six per cent. Analysts say this was on the back of investors anticipating the tech giant to unveil its first 5G smartphone later this week. Other tech giants fared well. Facebook, Amazon and Microsoft jumped 5.3 per cent, 5.2 per cent and 3.5 per cent respectively. Other sectors did not rise as much as the technology giants did.
